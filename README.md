# Abnormal-Behavior-Recognition-on-Campus-using-TST
Campus Abnormal Behavior Recognition detects suspicious activities using Temporal Segment Transformers (TST), YOLOv8, and CNNs. Built with Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it analyzes real-time and recorded footage for anomaly detection. Flask ensures lightweight deployment, making it ideal for campus security monitoring.
Campus Abnormal Behavior Recognition Using Temporal Segment Transformers

Overview
